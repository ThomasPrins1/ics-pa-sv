Once your solution code replaced these lines, it should accordingly *not* throw any exceptions anymore.\n",

This way, when we run our checks, the system will check the existence of the cell ids and verify the number of points and which checks must be run.

    "\n",
    "The goal of this task is to verify the accuracy of the learned dynamics. Namely, we will compare how well the learned dynamics match the nominal dynamics. We do this by initializing both the nominal and the learned dynamics at the same initial conditions (e.g. $\\theta(0)$ and $\\dot{\\theta}(0)$) and let both dynamics naturally evolve for 10s without applying any external torque to the links. We can then compute error metrics between the trajectory of the nominal and the learned system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you correctly implement this task, you will receive a baseline of 3 points. The remaining 12 points are distributed based on the prediction performance of your trained Lagrangian neural network. You will receive full points for this task if the Euclidean norm of the RMSE of the end-effector position between the nominal and the learned dynamics is **below** 0.10 m. If the error is between 0.10 m and 3.00 m, your grade will be linearly scaled with the error. However, if the error is larger than 3.00 m, you will not receive any credits for the performance of the Lagrangian neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** If your rollout performance is bad / not sufficient and you pass all the checks in the notebooks corresponding to tasks 2c.2-3, you are probably training your LNN on an unevenly distributed dataset / the dataset is not well-trained on the states that we visit during the rollout. Therefore, please tune the parameters of the dataset collection in Task 2c.1."
