Please note that it is **not** allowed to post any code relating to solution attempts. If you do have a particular question that you want to ask directly, please use the scheduled Q&A hours to ask the TA or if not possible otherwise, send an email to the instructor or TA.\n",

    "* This notebook will have in various places a line that throws a `NotImplementedError` exception. These are locations where the assignment requires you to adapt the code! These lines are just there as a reminder for you that you have not yet adapted that particular piece of code, especially when you execute all the cells. Once your solution code replaced these lines, it should accordingly *not* throw any exceptions anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) uses `nbgrader` to help us with automated tests. `nbgrader` will make various cells in this notebook \"uneditable\" or \"unremovable\" and gives them a special id in the cell metadata. This way, when we run our checks, the system will check the existence of the cell ids and verify the number of points and which checks must be run. While there are ways that you can edit the metadata and work around the restrictions to delete or modify these special cells, you should not do that since then our nbgrader backend will not be able to parse your notebook and give you points for the assignment. \n",

Therefore, we recommend that you only use Jupyter Notebook for this course. If you use any other editor, you may accidentally delete cells, modify the tests, etc., which would cause you to lose points.\n",
